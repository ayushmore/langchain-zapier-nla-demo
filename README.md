# LangChain and Zapier NLA Collaboration

This collaboration between LangChain and Zapier's Natural Language Actions (NLA) allows users to automate cross-communication tasks with the help of Zapier's 5k+ apps and 20k+ actions through a natural language API interface.

A Jupyter Notebook was used to automate the process of generating and publishing a tweet through a personal Twitter account in less than 10 minutes. This was achieved by importing packages such as OpenAI from langchain.llms, ZapierToolkit from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits and setting the environment variables for API keys.

Overall, the integration was found to be easy and quick to use, with endless possibilities for automation. Check out my [blog](https://ayushmore.github.io/posts/zapier.html) to see how to set it all up.
